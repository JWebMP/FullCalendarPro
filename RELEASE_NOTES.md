# Release Notes

## 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT (Documentation-First, Rules Update)
- Added the FullCalendar Pro topic index under `rules/generative/frontend/jwebmp/fullcalendar-pro`, including overview, layout, events/resources, Angular integration, testing, glossary, and release-note guides that reference the host architecture artifacts.
- Updated the host docs (README, RULES, GUIDES, GLOSSARY, IMPLEMENTATION, PROMPT_REFERENCE) so they surface the new topic index, keep the documentation loop closed, and highlight the prompt language alignment note for the pro glossary.
- Documented the forward-only deployment plan in `docs/implementation-plan.md` and recorded the stack context in `docs/PROMPT_REFERENCE.md` so future prompts load the same information before editing.
