# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added
- Documented the FullCalendar Pro rules topic (`rules/generative/frontend/jwebmp/fullcalendar-pro`) with modular guidance for options, resources, Angular integration, testing, and glossary alignments.
- Surface the new rules index in the host documentation loop (README, RULES, GUIDES, GLOSSARY, IMPLEMENTATION, PROMPT_REFERENCE) so future updates stay forward-only and traceable.
- Added release notes that summarize this documentation-first update and linked the architecture/diagram set to the new topic index.
