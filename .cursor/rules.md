# Cursor Rules
- Follow the Stage-Gated workflow: architecture/alignment docs before code, referencing `docs/architecture/README.md`, `PACT.md`, and this repo’s `RULES.md`.
- Back all doc/code proposals with references to `rules/` topic indexes (JWebMP, GuicedEE, Angular 20, Logging, JSpecify, Testing, CI) and keep outputs forward-only.
- Respect the Document Modularity Policy and update all inbound links when reorganizing docs.
- Use `rules/generative/frontend/jwebmp/fullcalendar-pro/README.md` as the source for Pro-specific explanations before rewriting adjacent host docs; keep the architecture/diagram links in lockstep.
